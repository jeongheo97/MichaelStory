This is the story of Bill the cat.
Bill was an animated cat, like Garfield and Tom, and enjoyed doing animated cat things.
He enjoyed chasing mice, eating lasagna, and relaxing.
Overall, he lived a simple, but pleasant life.
One day Bill was walking with his owner Will down to the park.
Going to the park was one of Bill's favorite things to do.
At the park Bill was free to happily frolic through the daisies.
Today, whilst frolicing, Bill came across another cat he had never seen before.  
The new cat's name was Tom.
Tom and Bill soon became friends.
They were always together. 
They chased mice, ate lasagnas, and relaxed together.
