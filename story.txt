This is the story of Bill the cat.
Bill was an animated cat, like Garfield and Tom, and enjoyed doing animated cat things.
He enjoyed chasing mice, eating lasagna, and relaxing.
Overall, he lived a simple, but pleasant life.
One day Bill was walking with his owner Will down to the park.
Going to the park was one of Bill's favorite things to do.
At the park Bill was free to happily frolic through the daisies.
Today, whilst frolicing, Bill came across another cat he had never seen before.  
That cat's name was Tom. 
Tom and Bill became very close friends and they had a fun time together whenever they went for a walk.
